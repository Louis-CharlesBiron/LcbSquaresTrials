Trying to make a little game :)




--------------------------------

Plan:

SETUP:
- game will just go on top of any webpage


GAMPELAY


- 9 rooms, that you have to go through
- 2d plateformer
- semi puzzle? Like, "Oh I need a key, dang it is in this other room"



- NO CONTEXT IDEAS
- you draw your own character
- you can go outside the game

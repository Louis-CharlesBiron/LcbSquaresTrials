Trying to make a little game :)




--------------------------------

Plan:

SETUP:




### NO CONTEXT IDEAS
- you draw your own character
- you can go outside the game üëç
- *semi puzzle? Like, "Oh I need a key, dang it is in this other room"?*
- water room
- click to tp room?
- gravity changing room
- a hidden pipe to traverse from and to a room üëç


GIMICS ideas:
- moving obstacles (spikes probably lol)
- radius changer thing
- orbs / temporary max jump increase
- wall climbing on specific walls
- needle gameplay lol?
- COLLECTIBLES (keys)
- disable jump ceiling cancellation to stick
